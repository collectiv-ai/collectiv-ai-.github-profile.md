# CollectiVAI Code of Conduct

> Democratic AI for Europe – created by people, for people.  
> This project is built on respect, dignity and collaboration.

This Code of Conduct applies to all projects under the **CollectiVAI** organisation,  
including code, issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation and community spaces.

It is intentionally simple and human, not legal.

---

## 1. Core Principles

At CollectiVAI, we aim to:

- treat **every person with respect and dignity**  
- create a **safe, inclusive and welcoming** environment  
- encourage **constructive feedback and learning**  
- avoid harm, discrimination and harassment  
- build tools that align with **human rights and democratic values**

This reflects our wider mission: **human-centred, democratic AI – Made in Europe.**

---

## 2. Expected Behaviour

We ask everyone involved in CollectiVAI projects to:

- Be **respectful and polite** in all interactions.  
- Assume **good intent** while staying critical of ideas, not people.  
- Give **constructive feedback** (specific, kind, actionable).  
- Use language that is **inclusive** and avoids slurs or insults.  
- Respect **boundaries**: if someone says a topic or behaviour is unwelcome, stop.  
- Keep discussions **on topic**: AI, infrastructure, security, democracy, open source.  

If you are unsure whether something is appropriate, choose the more considerate option.

## 3. Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviour is not acceptable in any CollectiVAI space:

- Harassment, hate speech or personal attacks  
- Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion, age or nationality  
- Threats, violence or encouragement of self-harm or harm to others  
- Sharing of illegal content or instructions to commit illegal acts  
- Persistent disruptive behaviour, trolling or bad-faith arguing  
- Non-consensual sharing of private information (doxing)

Breaches of this Code of Conduct may lead to warnings, removal of content  
or exclusion from the projects and communities.

## 4. AI, Security and Ethics

CollectiVAI works on **AI, cybersecurity and infrastructure**.  
This comes with special responsibilities:

- No development or sharing of tools whose **primary purpose** is harm, surveillance, exploitation or discrimination.  
- No requests or contributions focused on **illegal hacking, malware, fraud or abuse**.  
- Security research must follow **responsible disclosure** principles.  
- AI features should respect **privacy, consent and human dignity** as far as technically possible.

If you are unsure whether something fits our ethical boundaries, please ask first.

## 5. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. If you feel safe, you may ask the person to stop directly.  
2. You can contact the project maintainer(s) via:

   - **E-mail:** info@collectivai.org  
   - or via GitHub issues / direct message, if appropriate.

Please include:

- what happened (with links or screenshots if possible)  
- where it happened (repo, issue number, discussion, etc.)  
- approximate time / date  
- whether it is ongoing  

We will treat all reports **confidentially** and with care.

---

## 6. Consequences

Possible responses may include:

- clarifying a misunderstanding  
- a friendly reminder of our guidelines  
- formal warning  
- temporary or permanent removal from participation  
- blocking from the organisation or repositories

The exact response depends on the severity and context of the situation.  
We aim to be fair, transparent and to prioritise the **safety of the community**.

---

## 7. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- all repositories under the **collectiv-ai** GitHub organisation  
- issues, pull requests, comments and discussions  
- community calls or online sessions organised under the CollectiVAI name  
- any related communication channels announced in official repositories or on the website

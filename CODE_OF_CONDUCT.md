# CollectiVAI Code of Conduct

> Democratic, human-centred AI – built with respect, openness and care.

This Code of Conduct applies to **all projects** under the  
[`collectiv-ai`](https://github.com/collectiv-ai) organisation,  
including issues, discussions, pull requests, documentation and any other  
community spaces.

The primary working language is **English**, but **German** is welcome where helpful.

## 1. Our Principles

CollectiVAI is a project about **democracy, dignity and public interest**.  
We expect everyone in the community to act in a way that reflects these values:

- **Respect & empathy** – treat others with kindness, even when you disagree.
- **Inclusion** – no discrimination against any person or group.
- **Constructive collaboration** – focus on ideas, not on personal attacks.
- **Transparency** – be honest about limitations, risks and conflicts of interest.
- **Safety** – avoid behaviour, content or tools that put people at risk.

We want this to be a space where people from **cities, universities, NGOs, public
institutions, open-source communities and industry** can work together.

---

## 2. Expected Behaviour

In all CollectiVAI spaces we expect you to:

- Be **respectful** in language and tone.
- Be **open** to different perspectives and experiences.
- Give **constructive feedback** (specific, actionable, kind).
- Assume **good intent**, while still being aware of possible harm.
- Respect **privacy** and never share sensitive data without consent.
- Follow the **spirit of democratic dialogue**: listen, question, and build.

## 3. Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviour is **not acceptable** in CollectiVAI projects or spaces:

- Harassment, insults, threats or intimidation.
- Discrimination or hateful conduct based on  
  _e.g. gender, identity, origin, nationality, language, religion, disability,
  age, appearance, socio-economic status or political views_.
- Sharing violent, sexualised, demeaning or otherwise harmful content.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit consent.
- Misusing CollectiVAI projects for:
  - surveillance, repression or human-rights violations,
  - targeted harassment, disinformation or manipulation,
  - illegal activities or security attacks against uninvolved parties.
- Spamming, self-promotion without context, or repeated off-topic content.
- Any behaviour that makes others feel **unsafe, excluded or silenced**.

---

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- all repositories under `collectiv-ai`,
- all issues, pull requests and code reviews,
- GitHub Discussions, wikis and documentation,
- project-related spaces such as chats, calls, workshops or events  
  (online or offline) directly linked to CollectiVAI.

---

## 5. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct:

- You can **contact the project founder directly**:

  - ✉️ **info@collectivai.org**

- Please include (where possible):
  - what happened (with links or screenshots if available),
  - where it happened (which repo, issue, PR, platform),
  - approximate date/time,
  - any other context that might help understand the situation.

All reports will be handled **confidentially** and **in good faith**.
Retaliation against people who report incidents is **not tolerated**.

---

## 6. Enforcement

Possible actions in response to violations may include:

- a private, friendly reminder of this Code of Conduct,
- a request to edit or remove problematic content,
- temporary or permanent blocking from repositories,
- escalation to platform moderation (e.g. GitHub) where necessary.

Decisions are made by the project maintainer(s), with the goal of:

- protecting individuals,
- keeping the community safe,
- preserving the integrity of the project.

---

## 7. Alignment with Project Values

CollectiVAI is about:

- **democratic AI** instead of black-box control,
- **European values** such as privacy, human rights and rule of law,
- **public interest** instead of pure commercial exploitation.

This Code of Conduct is one of the tools to make sure  
our **community practices** reflect these goals.

If you have suggestions to improve it, feel free to open an issue or pull request  
in the `.github` repository of the organisation.

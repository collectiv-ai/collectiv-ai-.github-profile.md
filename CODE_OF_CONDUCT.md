# CollectiVAI Code of Conduct

CollectiVAI is an independent, human-centred project with a strong European focus.  
We want our community spaces to be safe, constructive and welcoming – for everyone.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- all repositories under the `collectiv-ai` GitHub organisation,
- issues, pull requests and discussions,
- project-related communication in other channels (where applicable).

---

## Our pledge

We, as members, contributors and maintainers, pledge to:

- treat each other with **respect and dignity**,
- keep discussions **constructive and focused on the topic**,
- be especially mindful of **newcomers** and people with different backgrounds,
- act in the spirit of **democratic, human-centred AI**.

There is **zero tolerance** for harassment, hate or dehumanising language.

---

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour that helps the community:

- using welcoming and inclusive language,
- giving constructive feedback instead of personal criticism,
- being open to different perspectives and experiences,
- focusing on what is best for users and the public interest,
- acknowledging mistakes and correcting them.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- harassment, insults, personal attacks or threats,
- discriminatory comments related to gender, identity, origin, religion, disability or similar,
- publishing private information without explicit permission,
- sustained disruption of discussions or work,
- using the project to promote hate, violence or disinformation.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces:

- GitHub issues, pull requests and discussions,
- documentation and comments,
- any other official communication channels used by CollectiVAI.

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it via:

- 📧 **info@collectivai.org** (subject line: `Code of Conduct`)

Please include, if possible:

- where it happened (repository, issue, PR),
- links or screenshots,
- a short description of what happened.

Reports will be treated with **discretion**. Public shaming is not expected or required.

---

## Enforcement

The project maintainer(s) may take appropriate action, including:

- asking someone to stop certain behaviour,
- hiding or editing comments (when clearly harmful),
- temporarily or permanently restricting participation in repositories.

In serious or repeated cases, users may be blocked from the organisation.

We aim to act **fairly, proportionally and transparently**, in line with the values of CollectiVAI.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open source practices  
and adapted for the CollectiVAI project and its democratic AI focus.

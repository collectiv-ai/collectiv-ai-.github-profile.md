# CollectiVAI – Code of Conduct

CollectiVAI is a project about **democratic, human-centred AI**.  
We want a space that is safe, respectful and constructive for everyone.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- all repositories under the `collectiv-ai` organisation,
- all issues, pull requests and discussions,
- all community spaces related to CollectiVAI (online or offline).

---

## 1. Our Values

We try to build software that reflects our values:

- **Respect** – we treat each other with courtesy and good faith.  
- **Inclusivity** – everyone is welcome, independent of background or identity.  
- **Constructive collaboration** – we focus on solving problems, not on attacking people.  
- **Openness** – questions are allowed, beginners are welcome.  
- **Responsibility** – we are careful with topics like security, democracy and AI ethics.

---

## 2. Expected Behaviour

Please:

- use clear, respectful language,
- be patient with different experience levels,
- assume good intentions first,
- give constructive, specific feedback,
- respect privacy and confidentiality where needed,
- follow the repository guidelines (CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, LICENSE, etc.).

---

## 3. Unacceptable Behaviour

We do **not** accept:

- harassment, insults, personal attacks,
- discriminatory language (racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.),
- threats or encouragement of violence,
- sharing of private data without consent,
- deliberate spread of misinformation in the context of the project,
- spam, trolling or off-topic noise in issues/PRs.

If you are not sure whether something is okay – treat people with extra care.

## 4. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. You can contact the maintainer/founder directly:  
   **info@collectivai.org**

2. Or, if appropriate, open an issue in the relevant repository  
   (for example when it is purely technical / organisational).

Please include:

- a short description of what happened,
- where (which repo, issue, PR, platform),
- optional: screenshots or links.

We will treat all reports as confidential and handle them with care.

---

## 5. Consequences

Possible actions include (depending on severity and context):

- friendly clarification or reminder,
- request to edit or remove problematic content,
- temporary or permanent blocking from issues/PRs,
- removal from the organisation or project spaces.

The goal is **not punishment**, but to protect the community and its values.

---

## 6. Scope & Changes

This Code of Conduct applies to **all CollectiVAI repositories**  
and may be updated as the project grows.

If you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue  
in the `.github` repository or contact: **info@collectivai.org**.
